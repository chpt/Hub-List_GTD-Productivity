{"tagline":"Open source GTD style productivity as a CouchApp written entirely in Ext JS 4.","body":"# Hub List\r\nHub List is an [open source GTD style productivity app](http://hublistapp.com) written entirely in JavaScript using [Ext JS 4](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/). It's a [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org/page/what-is-couchapp) which means it can be served directly from any CouchDB instance without the need for a separate server side application stack!\r\n\r\n![Screenshots](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/946636/HL-Readme-Screnshots.png)\r\n\r\n## Status\r\nHub List is no longer actively being developed. I currently don't have time to continue work on this project. I'm still interested in building a lightweight productivity app that provides a single view of tasks spread across different services like Pivotal Tracker, Jira and Basecamp. \r\n\r\n## App Requirements\r\n- [CouchDB](http://www.couchbase.com/downloads) (1.1+)\r\n- A modern web browser\r\n\r\n## Deployment Requirements\r\nTo start using Hub List you'll need these tools to push the application code into an instance of CouchDB. These don't have be installed on the same machine as your CouchDB instance as long as they can access the CouchDB instance where you want Hub List installed.\r\n\r\n- [NodeJS](https://github.com/joyent/node) (0.4.0+)\r\n- [node.couchapp.js](https://github.com/mikeal/node.couchapp.js)\r\n\r\n## Installing Hub List\r\n1. Create a database on your instance of CouchDB. You can name the database anything.  \r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/hublist\r\n``` \r\n\r\n2. clone this repo  \r\n```\r\ngit clone  https://github.com/rawberg/Hub-List_GTD-Productivity Hub-List\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. push the code into the database you created (requires [node.couchapp.js](https://github.com/mikeal/node.couchapp.js))  \r\n```\r\ncd Hub-List\r\n```  \r\n```\r\ncouchapp push couchapp.js http://127.0.0.1:5984/hublist \r\n```\r\n\r\n4. open the index.html file in your browser and enjoy!  \r\n```\r\nhttp://127.0.0.1:5984/hublist/_design/app/index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrading Hub List\r\n1. Pull the latest changes  \r\n```\r\ncd Hub-List \r\n```  \r\n```   \r\ngit pull  \r\n```\r\n\r\n2. push the updated code into your database  \r\n```\r\ncouchapp push couchapp.js http://127.0.0.1:5984/hublist \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Wishlist\r\n- Distribute CouchApps as native desktop applications.\r\n\r\nI'd love to distribute native desktop versions of Hub List for Mac, Windows and Linux. If anyone has experience or a desire to hack the CouchDB source code and existing platform intallers so desktop versions of CouchDB could immediately launch into a CouchApp, let me know.\r\n\r\n## Developer Contributions & Discussion\r\nContributions are welcome!
